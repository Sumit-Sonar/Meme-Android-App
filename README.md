# Meme
In this meme app, random memes are loaded into an ImageView from a meme API server. Users can easily switch to a new meme by tapping the "Next" button, allowing them to enjoy a continuous stream of amusing content. Additionally, the app offers a convenient "Share" button that enables users to effortlessly share their favorite memes with friends and family. This GitHub project aims to provide an enjoyable and engaging meme browsing experience while promoting seamless meme sharing among users.
